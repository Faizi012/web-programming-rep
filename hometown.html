<h1><center>HISTORY</center></h1>
<h3><center>When the Portuguese penetrated the Indian Ocean in the late 15th century and reached India’s southwestern coast, the Portuguese navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral founded the first European settlement on Indian soil at Kochi in 1500. Vasco da Gama, discoverer of the sea route to India (1498), established the first Portuguese factory (trading station) there in 1502, and the Portuguese viceroy Afonso de Albuquerque built the first European fort in India there in 1503. The city remained a Portuguese possession until it was conquered by the Dutch in 1663. Much Portuguese architecture still exists in the city.

Under Dutch rule (1663–1795) Kochi had its greatest prosperity. Through its harbour were shipped pepper, cardamom, and other spices and drugs as well as coir, coconut, and copra. All the city’s ethnic and religious groups, including its Hindu majority and the Muslim, Syrian Christian, and Jewish minorities, shared in the city’s prosperity.

British rule over Kochi lasted from 1795 until 1947, when India became independent. At the beginning of the 20th century, a modern port with dry docks and ship repair yards was constructed, and Willingdon Island (connecting Fort Cochin with Ernakulam and other townships by a rail bridge and road) was built from the dredgings of the harbour’s inner channels. After India’s independence, Kochi became the major training centre for the Indian Navy.

The synagogue was built in 1568 by the city’s prosperous Jewish trading community, originally consisting of Sephardic Jews who had been exiled from Spain and Portugal decades earlier. The consolidation of Portuguese power in western India in the mid-16th century saw the beginning of a turbulent period for the city’s Jewish community, as local officials of the Inquisition attempted to extirpate the religion, and the synagogue was destroyed by fire in 1662. However, with the subsequent Dutch settlement of the surrounding Malabar Coast in 1663, prosperity returned to the Jewish community, and the synagogue was restored.</center></h3>
